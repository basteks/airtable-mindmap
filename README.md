# Airtable Mind map

A script that allows you to visualize your data as a mind map, based on the [Airtable Extensions](https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-extensions-overview).

## Usage
- the mindmap.html file needs to be hosted somewhere (you can use [https://basteks.github.io/mindmap.html](https://basteks.github.io/mindmap.html) for testing purpose only)
- the content of the airtable_mindmap.js file needs to be copied in a new Scripting Extension in your Airtable base (warning, Extensions are not available with free plan !)

Once you create your Extension, access the settings page by clicking the gear icon in the top right corner
Here are the available settings :
- *URL* of the mindmap.html file. The style of the map is base on the file jsmind.css but, for now, we consider, that this file is in the same folder as mindmap.html.
- *Table* : the table containing the records you want to visualize
- *View* : the view containing the records
- *Name field* : the field containing the name displayed in the mind map's nodes
- *Relationship field* : the field containing the relationship (parent/child) bewteen the nodes
- *Relationship* : let you choose which kind of relationship is described in the relationship field : parent, or child
- *Root node* : let you choose if there is a root node in your records, or if it as to be created on top of your records
- *Map title* : the name of the map (displayed in the root node if you haven't one in your records, or as the html page title if you do)

## Limitations
As all the displayed data (data to display and ids of the parentnodes) are passed through the URL of the map, you may encounter a _414 URI Too Long_ error if you try to display too much markers or too much data for each marker on your map.

## ToDo
- Add support for special field rendering like URLs, mails or attachment by creating an html `href` link, and images.
- Convert this script to a proper extension in order to avoid the mindmap.html file hosting and to get rid of the potential _414 URI Too Long_ error.
